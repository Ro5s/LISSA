^**MAKING PAYMENTS FROM YOUR EARNED INCOME.**

^^**Payment Term.** Your Payment Term will start immediately upon graduation or upon your withdrawal from the Higher Education or Training (identified in *Section 2.a*), whichever is first to occur. However, the obligation to make Monthly Payments will occur only if you are earning the Qualified Monthly Earned Income. Your Payment Term will end upon Payment Satisfaction (as described in *Section 2.b*).

^^**Reporting of all Earned Income.** Upon completion of your Higher Education or Training and throughout the Payment Term, you agree to communicate to the Company and/or Processing Agent, using the Processing Agent Platform, (i) all employment positions you accept, including, if requested, a description as to the business and services or products provided by each employer and the nature of your position with each employer, (ii) your base salary for each employment position, (iii) your projected annual gross Earned Income from all Employers, including any Earned Income from self-employment, and (iv) any non-cash consideration, equity or deferred compensation rights granted to you.

^^**Methods of Payment.** Prior to but no later than the commencement of the Payment Term, you agree to elect to one of two options for payment to us of the Monthly Payment:

^^^**Automatic Withdrawal from Approved Bank Account.** You will elect to allow Processing Agent, as the Company's processing agent, to automatically deduct your Monthly Payment from you Approved Bank Account, as described below; or

^^^**Credit Card Payment.** You will provide Processing Agent, as the Company's processing agent, with a credit card number and execute an authorization for payment by credit card and such other documentation as may be required to authorize Processing Agent to charge Monthly Payments to your designated credit card on a recurring basis.

^^^**Withdrawal of Authorization for Auto Payments.** You have the right at any time before or during the Payment Term, subject to giving Processing Agent at least 3 days' notice prior to a payment, to revoke your prior authorization for auto payment from either your Approved Bank Account or from your designated credit card. Should you elect to do so, this shall not relieve you or your obligations to pay the Monthly Payment and you agree to either elect the alternate method of auto payment provided in *Section 4.d* or to send the Monthly Payment to Processing Agent via check or money order, to such address as shall be provided by Processing Agent upon receipt of your notice of withdrawal of authorization for automatic payments.

^^**Approved Bank Account.**

^^^**Set Up and Maintenance of Approved Bank Account.** You agree to establish a bank account with a financial institution designated or approved by Processing Agent in writing ("***Approved Bank Account***") prior to receiving any Earned Income, and also to permit integration of the Approved Bank Account with Processing Agent's Platform in order to permit Processing Agent to track your Earned income, to perform Reconciliation, and, subject to your payment election in *Section 4.d* above, to process and withdraw your Monthly Payments from your Approved Bank Account. You further agree to provide us or Processing Agent with details of the Approved Bank Account as we may reasonably request from time to time. If for any reason (*e.g.*, a change in your employment or address), you would like to change your Approved Bank Account to another bank, you agree to give Processing Agent prior notice of the requested change and such details for the proposed replacement account as Processing Agent may reasonably request and that the new bank account will be subject to Processing Agentâ€™s prior approval. If at any time during the Payment Term you change your password to your Approved Bank Account or otherwise take any action that alters the ability of Processing Agent to access, you agree to give Processing Agent prompt notice of the change and to comply with all requests of Processing Agent to permit it to reconnect to your Approved Bank Account with the Processing Agent Platform in order to permit Processing Agent to continue to track your Earned Income, perform Reconciliation, and, as applicable, process and withdraw any payments owed pursuant to this ISA.

^^^**Right to Require Change of Approved Bank Account.** Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, and even if you already have an established Approved Bank Account, you agree that the Company and/or Processing Agent, as the Company's processing agent, may require you during the Payment Term to open and maintain a new account with a financial institution designated by the Company and/or Processing Agent, and that you will promptly, following notice from the Company and/or Processing Agent, establish a new account with the designated financial institution and that such account shall then become the Approved Bank Account. You further agree to execute all such documents and consents to open the new Approved Bank Account. You also agree to authorize integration of the Approved Bank Account with the Processing Agent Platform in order for Processing Agent to monitor your Earned Income and, if you have so elected pursuant to *Section 4.d*, to authorize Processing Agent to withdraw Monthly Payments from the Approved Bank Account.

^^^**Deposit of all Earned Income into Approved Bank Account.** You agree that during the entire Payment Term you shall deposit all Earned Income received by you from any sources (whether earned as an employee or as an independent contractor) directly into your Approved Bank Account. If you are an employee, you agree to cause your Employer to arrange for the direct deposit of all of your Earned Income to your Approved Bank Account. Your refusal or failure to establish the Approved Bank Account or to permit integration with the Processing Agent platform for purposes of making Monthly Payments shall not relieve you of any of your obligations to make Monthly Payments under this Agreement.

^^^**Payment Deferrals and Extensions of Payment Term.** We shall place your ISA in deferment status and not accept payments for any month that your Monthly Earned Income does not exceed the Minimum Monthly Amount (a "***Deferred Month***"), until such time as your Monthly Earned Income exceeds, or is deemed to exceed (pursuant to a Reconciliation) the Minimum Monthly Amount, at which time your obligation to make Monthly Payments shall be reinstated. There is a 60-month limit on the aggregate number of months that Monthly Payments may be deferred. If you reach the maximum number of Deferred Months permitted under this ISA, your payment obligations under this ISA will be terminated.

^^^**Survival of Obligations.** Expiration of the Payment Term only terminates your obligation to make Monthly Payments from Qualified Monthly Earned Income. However, it does not terminate this ISA or any continuing obligations you may have to Company or Processing Agent pursuant to this ISA, including but not limited to the obligation to make additional payment if we determine that you underreported your Earned Income.

^**RECONCILIATION.** From time to time during the Payment Term, and for a period of one (1) year following the end of the calendar year in which the Payment Term expires, Company and Processing Agent, as its processing agent, shall have the right to examine and audit your records pertaining to your employment and to verify your Earned Income at any point during the Payment Term to make sure that you have properly reported or projected your Earned Income and to verify that we have properly calculated and deducted the Monthly Payments (a "***Reconciliation***"). You agree to cooperate with the Company and Processing Agent in performing any Reconciliation.

^^**Confirmation of Earned Income and Employment.** In order to perform a Reconciliation, you agree that you shall, within thirty (30) days of request:

^^^verify your Earned Income as reported to the IRS by filling out form IRS Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ (or any successor form) or, if we request in the alternative, provide us with a true and accurate copy of your federal tax return as submitted to the IRS for any calendar year of the Payment Term;

^^^provide us with the name, address and phone number of any Employers from which you have received Earned Income and authorize each of your Employers to disclose to us all forms of cash and non-cash compensation paid or provided to you; and

^^^provide such other documentation (including a summary of any non-written or oral non-cash consideration, equity or deferred compensation arrangements) as may be reasonably requested by the Company or Processing Agent for the purpose of performing the Reconciliation.

^^**Underreported Earned Income.**

^^^If at any time during the Payment Term and whether intentionally or unintentionally, you underreport your Earned Income to us, resulting in one or more deferred Monthly Payments, or one or more lower Monthly Payments to us than we are entitled to receive under this Agreement, we will have the right to correct the error, in our discretion, by (A) increasing your "Income Share" for Monthly Payments payable to us for each subsequent Qualified Income Earning Month, to a maximum of 150% of your defined "Income Share" percentage, or (B) retaining your Income Share percentage but adding a fixed monthly underpayment fee which shall not exceed $1,000.00 per month ("***Underpayment Fee***"), until the discrepancy in payments to us has been corrected. At such time, the Income Share percentage will revert to the original Income Share percentage as defined in *Section 1*, Definitions, or the Underpayment Fee will cease.

^^^If a Reconciliation performed by us pursuant to *Section 5* indicates that you underreported your Earned Income to us at any time during the Payment Term, so that you made one or more lower Monthly Payments to us than we are entitled to receive under this Agreement, we or Processing Agent shall give you notice within ten (10) days of completion of the Reconciliation of the amount of the underpayment and reasonable documentation of the underpayment calculation. You agree to pay us the aggregate amount of the underpayments within sixty (60) days of receiving notice of the underpayment. If you do not pay us on time, you authorize Processing Agent to deduct the amount of your underpayment from your Approved Bank Account. If the Approved Bank Account is no longer active or there are insufficient funds to pay the underpayment, we may exercise our legal rights to collect such underpayment, and you agree to pay our reasonable costs of collection, including our reasonable attorneys' fees.

^^^If a Reconciliation performed by us, or an Overpayment Claim made by you pursuant to *Section 5.c.i* below, for any year shows that your Derived Monthly Income for any month in which you made a Monthly Payment to us was less than the amount of Qualified Monthly Earned Income on which such Monthly Payment was calculated, such Monthly Payment will not be reduced or otherwise refunded unless you can demonstrate with documentation reasonably satisfactory to us that such payment was the result of a manifest error.

^^^If a Reconciliation performed for any year shows that your Derived Monthly Income for any month was more than the amount of Monthly Earned Income you reported to us for such month, your Monthly Earned Income for such month shall be deemed to equal the Derived Monthly Income, and any additional amounts payable to us will be subject to recapture pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above, as the case may be.

^^**Overreported Earned Income.**

^^^If at any time during the Payment Term, for any reason, you overreport your Earned Income to us, resulting in larger Monthly Payments to us than we are entitled to receive under this Agreement, you will have the right to notify us of this, and provide any documentation that we may reasonably request (including any documents we would review pursuant to a Reconciliation) in order to verify your claim of overpayment ("***Overpayment Claim***"). If, after reviewing the documents, we agree with your Overpayment Claim, we will correct the error by, in our discretion, (A) refunding the amount of the Overpayment Claim to your Approved Bank Account in a single payment or by equal payments over a period not to exceed 6 months, or (B) decreasing your "Income Share" percentage of Monthly Payments payable to us for each subsequent Qualified Income Earning Month, by not less than 10% in each Monthly Payment, until the overage in payments to us has been corrected. At such time, the Income Share Percentage, if it was previously adjusted, will revert to the original Income Share Percentage as defined in *Section 1*, *Definitions*.

^^^If the Payment Term ends prior to correction of the overage in payments under the procedure described in *Section 4(c)(i)* above, then Company shall pay you the balance of any remaining overpayment amount within thirty (30) days of the end of the Payment Term.

^^**Extension of Time for Reconciliation.** If you should file for an extension of the time to file your federal income tax returns or if you fail to provide us with the requested tax, Employer or Earned Income information or you do not otherwise reasonably cooperate with us for purposes of Reconciliation, then the one (1) period following the end of the calendar year in which the Payment Term expires shall be extended for a period of time equal to the period of time that you failed to provide the requested information or you obtained the filing extension. It is the intent of this provision that the running of the one (1) year period following the end of the calendar year in which the Payment Term expires shall be extended so that the Company shall get the full and reasonable opportunity to perform Reconciliation and so that you may not benefit from your failure to comply with your obligations or you obtained the extension.

^**CAP ON PAYMENTS; PREPAYMENT AMOUNT.**

^^**Payment Cap.** The total Monthly Payments you owe under this Agreement will not exceed the Payment Cap.

^^**Prepayment Amount.** You may at any time pay in full your obligation to the Company by paying an amount equal to the Payment Cap less any Monthly Payments you already made plus any outstanding amounts you may owe us, as satisfaction in full of your payment obligations under this Agreement.

^**ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING PAYMENTS.**

^^**Limit on Other Income Share Agreements.** You agree that you have not and will not enter into additional income share agreements or similar arrangements with us or another Person that, in the aggregate, obligate you to pay a total Income Share exceeding 30.0% percent of your Earned Income.

^^**International Work.** If you move out of the United States during your Payment Term, you agree to continue to report Earned Income and to continue paying your Income Share of your Qualified Monthly Earned Income, and you shall not be in Breach of this Agreement so long as you continue to make the required Monthly Payments.

^^**Waiver of ISA Due to Death or Total and Disability.** We will waive what you owe under this Agreement, including any past due amounts and fees, if you die or become disabled. If you would like to assert a waiver based on disability, you will need to provide documentation showing that you have been found to be disabled by the Social Security Administration or other federal or state agency due to a condition that began or deteriorated after the date of signing this Agreement and that the disability is expected to be permanent.

^^**Obligation in Event of Withdrawal.** If for any reason and at any time you withdraw from the Higher Education or Training related to this Agreement, you may be entitled to a *pro rata* reduction in your committed Income Share percentage or the length of the Payment Term, but solely at the discretion of the Company. You agree to give the Company and Processing Agent prompt notice of your withdrawal from the Higher Education or Training and the effective date of your withdrawal.

^**REVIEW OF YOUR TAX RETURNS.** For the tax year in which your Payment Term begins through the tax year in which your Payment Term ends, you agree to file your U.S. federal income tax returns, no later than April 15 of the following year, and to timely file any state or local tax returns by the date they are due. You agree to notify us of any extension you seek for filing federal income tax returns. Moreover, upon our or Processing Agent's request, you agree to sign and file IRS Form 4506-T or Form 4506T-EZ (or any successor form) within thirty (30) days of request, designating each of the Company (or its then-applicable Assignee) and Processing Agent as the designated recipients of your tax return information for returns covering any and all years of your Payment Term. You agree to perform any similar requirements or procedures for any other applicable country's taxing authority.

^**TAX REPORTING.** The Company intends to report the tax consequence of the ISA on its tax returns as a financial contract that is eligible for open transaction treatment. The Company believes that this tax treatment is more likely than not the proper characterization for federal income tax purposes. We urge you to consult with your own tax advisors, to ascertain the appropriate manner in which to report your taxes. We believe that there is a potential benefit if all parties to a transaction report in a consistent fashion. We encourage you to report in a manner that is consistent for all parties to the transaction. We recognize that there may be specific situations where the Company or you may find it appropriate to report in a way that is inconsistent with the other Party. You are once again, urged to consult with your tax advisors about the potential consequences of such reporting.

If we are the Complaining Party, we will send the Claim Notice to you at your address appearing in our records or, if you are known to be represented by an attorney, to your attorney at his or her office address. Any Claim Notice must explain the nature of the Claim and the relief that is demanded. The Complaining Party must reasonably cooperate in providing any information about the Claim that the Defending Party reasonably requests. The provisions of this *Section 18* shall survive termination of this Agreement.

^**ARBITRATION OF CLAIMS AGAINST COMPANY.** Except as expressly provided below, Student agrees that any past, present or future claim, dispute or controversy Student may have against the Company, regardless of the legal theory on which it is based, arising out of, relating to or occurring in connection with this Agreement (a "***Claim***"), shall be submitted to and resolved by binding arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Â§Â§1 *et seq.* (the "***FAA***") before the American Arbitration Association (the "***AAA***") under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is brought (the "***AAA Rules***", which are available online at www.adr.org). If the AAA is unable to serve as administrator and the Company and the Student cannot agree on a replacement, a court with jurisdiction will select the administrator or arbitrator. This means that any Claim you have shall be resolved by a neutral third-party arbitrator, and not by a judge or a
jury, and you hereby knowingly and voluntarily waive the right to trial on such Claim any court of law or equity. 

For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement: (a) the term "Claim" has the broadest possible meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims. It includes disputes based upon contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other intentional torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for injunctive or declaratory relief). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement; (b) the term "Company" includes (i) the Company, (ii) any assignee of this Agreement, (iii) any assignee, agent, designee or servicer of the Company (including but not limited to Processing Agent), (iv) the officers, directors, employees, affiliates, subsidiaries, and parents of all of the foregoing, and (e) any Person named as a co-defendant with the Company in a Claim asserted by the Student, such as servicers and debt collectors; and (c) the term "Student" means the Student executing this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if a Claim that the Student wishes to assert against the Company is cognizable in a small claims court (or your state's equivalent court) having jurisdiction over the Claim and the Parties, the Student or the Company may pursue such Claim in that small claims court; provided, however, that if the Claim is transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court, it shall then be resolved by arbitration. Moreover, any dispute concerning the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement must be decided by a court; any dispute concerning the validity or enforceability of the ISA as a whole is for the arbitrator.

Any arbitration hearing that you attend will take place before a single arbitrator and shall be held in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your address. If you cannot obtain a waiver of the AAA's or arbitrator's filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees, we will consider in good faith any request by you for us to bear such fees. Each Party will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts and witnesses, regardless of which Party prevails, unless applicable law or this Agreement gives a right to recover any of those fees from the other Party.

The arbitrator shall follow applicable substantive law to the extent consistent with the FAA, applicable statutes of limitation and privilege rules that would apply in a court proceeding, but subject to any limitations as may be set forth in this Agreement.

This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment of your obligations under this Agreement and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between this Arbitration Agreement and the administrator's rules or other provisions of this Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will govern.

CLASS ACTION WAIVER: IF A CLAIM IS ARBITRATED, STUDENT WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION, EITHER AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER. Further, unless both Student and the Company agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator may not join or consolidate Claims with claims of any other persons. The arbitrator shall have no authority to conduct any class, private attorney general or other representative proceeding, and shall award declaratory or injunctive relief only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that Student's individual Claim. If a determination is made in a proceeding involving the Company and the Student that the class action waiver is invalid or unenforceable, only this sentence of this Arbitration Agreement will remain in force and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, provided, that the determination concerning the class action waiver shall be subject to appeal.

RIGHT TO REJECT: You may reject this Arbitration Agreement by emailing a rejection notice to the Company at such email address as the Company or Processing Agent may provide to you from time to time within thirty (30) calendar days after the date of full execution of this Agreement. Any rejection notice must include (i) your name and address, (ii) your cellular telephone number(s); (iii) your account number, if applicable; and shall state that you are rejecting this Arbitration Agreement in your Agreement. If you reject this Arbitration Agreement, that will not affect any other provisions of the ISA or your obligations under this Agreement.

^LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT CAUSED BY THE WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF COMPANY OR PROCESSING AGENT, NEITHER COMPANY NOR PROCESSING AGENT SHALL BE LIABLE TO STUDENT FOR LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT, LOST INCOME OR PROFITS, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF ADVISED BY STUDENT OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 20 SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

^**SURVIVAL OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the provisions of *Sections 3* (Payment Management by Processing Agent), *5* (Reconciliation), *9* (Tax Reporting), *10* (Covenants and Representations of Student), *12* (Breach and Remedies), *13* (Retained Rights), *14* (Electronic Delivery), *18* (Notice and Cure), *19* (Arbitration), *20* (Limitation of Liability) and *21* (General Provisions) shall survive termination of this Agreement, your fulfillment of your obligations under this Agreement and/or your or our bankruptcy or insolvency (to the extent permitted by applicable law).
